# Happy New Year!! (2026)

I’m Eshan, and I’m starting this blog as my personal online journal — for this year and the years that follow.
This is a place where I’ll document what I learn, what I try, what works, and what doesn’t.
Nothing fancy. Just honest records of my journey from this point onward.

If you’re reading this, I wish you a very happy new year 🙂

**Personal things I want to work on:**

1. Going to the gym regularly
2. Learning how to be consistent
3. Documenting and Experimenting with my life and learnings
4. Mental Conditioning

I’ll add more plans as I go.
This blog will evolve as I do.
