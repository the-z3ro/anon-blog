I’m Eshan a computer science student, and this blog is my personal online journal. It starts this year and keeps going.

I made this space for one reason: to trap what I learn, what sticks, and what quietly changes me. One day I’ll scroll back and see how far I’ve walked.

I’m not writing for a crowd.  
I’m writing to my future self.

This is proof I showed up. Proof I grew.  
A living reminder that we overestimate a day and underestimate a year.

The internet lately feels like a glossy magazine: AI-polished, keyword-stuffed, shiny and empty.  
This place won’t be.

I’ll tidy the grammar, but the words stay rough, the thoughts unfiltered.  
No fake hype, no drama for clicks, no algorithm gymnastics.  
Just one guy who’d rather build than perform.

If you like quiet work,  
if you respect people who grind without a megaphone,  
if code beats gossip and independence beats applause  
you might like it here.

**Right now I’m running two tracks in parallel:**

1. Web development - my technical bedrock.
2. Copywriting & freelancing - bills, freedom, and a weird love for how minds get persuaded.

I won’t chain myself to either one.  
Some days it’s React and routers.  
Some days it’s C++, Python, Bash, or wrestling a Linux box until it surrenders.  
Some days it’s a movie scene that won’t leave my head or a thought that arrives at 2 a.m.

The blog will mirror that mess.  
No niche, just a learning curve in real time.

I’ll post weekly—more if life hands me something worth pinning down.  
I’ll share what I’m building, breaking, understanding, and doubting.

Occasionally I’ll write about things that move me slower than code.  
Take the film _Paterson_. Nothing explodes; the guy just lives, watches, accepts.  
That stillness looks like enlightenment to me.  
How someone carries failure, disagreement, and sadness tells me more than any resume bullet.

I want to become that kind of quiet.

I’m no expert.  
I’m a learner taking notes with the door open.

The blog will grow as I do.  
Topics will drift. Goals will evolve.  
But every line will stay honest.
